# Downloading the Files

To download the files, and view the source code, we can visit the GitHub page of Lewis Menelaws.

To begin downloading the files, visit this [link](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot). Once you are there, you should see an option saying **code.**

Once you click it, you should see a **download zip** option, as seen in the screenshot.

Once you click that, you should select your download location for the files or check your **downloads folder.**&#x20;

Once done, unzip the files.
